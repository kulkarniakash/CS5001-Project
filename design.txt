Testing of the graphics component of the program was done at each stage of development.
A potential overflow of coins was tested for by attempting torepeatedly dropping coins 
in the same column beyond full capacity. Superfluous clicks were tested for by clicking
the same drop button rapidly in succession while a coin was still falling.
